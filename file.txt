When Douglas Adams wrote The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, he added a central joke which has become more famous over the years than the novel itself: "The answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe and everything is 42."
Geeks have since wasted years and massive effort trying to ascribe some deep, symbolic significance to the number and its occurrences.
Now, in an attempt to cash in on their obsession, a new book published this week, 42: Douglas Adams' Amazingly Accurate Answer to Life, the Universe and Everything, looks at real-life occurrences of the number 42. 
The book is timed to coincide with the 10th anniversary of Adams's death this spring.
